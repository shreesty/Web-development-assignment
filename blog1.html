<h1> 10 Tips For Planning A Successful Road Trip</h1>

<div class="img1"></div>
<p>
    There’s nothing quite like standing at the top of a mountain, thousands of miles away from where you started, thinking back about how you got there. 
    Taking a cross-country trip with some of your best friends is the best way to see this beautiful land and all it has to offer! 
    That being said, it’s vital to plan for the unexpected and hit the road fully prepared. 
    These ten tips will get you started in the right direction to the perfect road trip.

    <h2>Pick A Time To Leave (And Stick With It)</h2>
<p>Committing to a road trip may be the hardest part of the whole planning process. 
You’ll have friends and relatives that will call you crazy, ask about your “long term goals” and shake their head at the idea of you living out of a car for an extended period of time. 
So set a date, and stick with it. Once you mark your calendar, everything else with fall into place. 
You’re committed and nothing is worse than backing out and your coworkers asking, “Hey, why are you still here? Weren’t you supposed to go on that trip this month? </p>

<h2>Less Is More</h2>
<p>Trust me on this one. The less you can start with the better.
A perfectly packed car will soon turn into a collection of trash, dirty clothes and lost belongings that only a hoarder could love. 
The extra space will come in handy when you’re trying to sprawl out across the back seat or find that way-too-big souvenir you just have to have.</p>

<h2>Buy A National Park Pass </h2>
<p>If you’re planning on doing a lot camping and hiking, this is a must have. Not only will this pass get you into any National Park at no cost, but The Forest Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management and Bureau of Reclamation honor your pass wherever fees are charged! You can pick one up online here.
