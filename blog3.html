<h1>What Is The Impact Of Artificial Intelligence (AI) On Society?</h1>

<p>As with most changes in life, there will be positive and negative impacts on society as artificial intelligence continues to transform the world we live in. 
    How that will balance out is anyoneâ€™s guess and up for much debate and for many people to contemplate. 
    As an optimist at heart, I believe the changes will mostly be good but could be challenging for some. 
    Here are some of the challenges that might be faced (and we should be thinking about how to address them now) as well as several of the positive impacts artificial intelligence will have on society.</p>

<h2 class="challenges">Challenges to be faced: </h2>

    <p> Artificial intelligence will definitely cause our workforce to evolve.
         The alarmist headlines emphasise the loss of jobs to machines, but the real challenge is for humans to find their passion with new responsibilities that require their uniquely human abilities.
          According to PwC, 7 million existing jobs will be replaced by AI in the UK from 2017-2037, but 7.2 million jobs could be created. 
          This uncertainty and the changes to how some will make a living could be challenging.
        The transformative impact of artificial intelligence on our society will have far-reaching economic, legal, political and regulatory implications that we need to be discussing and preparing for. 
            Determining who is at fault if an autonomous vehicle hurts a pedestrian or how to manage a global autonomous arms race are just a couple of examples of the challenges to be faced.
